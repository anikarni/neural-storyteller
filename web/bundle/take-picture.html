      <p id="story">We had to the group of people at the beach , but for the first time in my life , it felt like they were going to fall apart . I was n't really sure what the beach was going to be . I had never seen Nate so beautiful , and he had no intention of helping her out on the beach . As soon as the sun came up , she shook her head and let go of my arm . Heat spread through my body , reminding me that Lissa and I have been friends for almost twenty-four thousand years . I was more than willing to ignore the group , at the beach people left .</p>
